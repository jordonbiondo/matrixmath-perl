* Matrix Math Perl
This project is a reimplementation of [[https://github.com/jordonbiondo/matrixmath][matrixmath]] in perl.

The backend has been rewritten in perl, the frontend has been largely untouched and remains in its atrocious historical state, serving as a nice reminder of how far I've come since college. üòÅ

You can check out the live version [[https://matrix-math-perl.herokuapp.com/][here]].
